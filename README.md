ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF LANDSLIDE USING MACHINE

LEARNING ALGORITHM

The project idea is the experimentation of how efficiently a
machine learning algorithm can predict occurrence of landslide in a given area by
analysing dataset including prone features in that area causing landslide. This idea
and the followed project is done as an attempt to reduce the impact of landslide on
human race. The basic principle behind the machine learning model developed as
part of the project is the fact that landslide unlike other natural disasters is not an odd
phenomenon but is caused due to various factors which mostly undergo graduality.
This phenomenon is said to be caused by more than 30 factors. Some of them are
sensitive and gradual while others are not.
The method of prediction used in machine learning algorithm
is logistic regression. Though prediction using linear regression is also possible the
former is observed to give better accuracy. Data is collected for the most dependent
factors of landslide, and they are classified on the basics of intensity in a given
region or type present. This primitive form of data is further developed into a data set
suitable for the algorithm.
The algorithm is first trained with a certain developed portion
of data set and then when the desired mean accuracy is achieved, the model is
deployed for the rest of data set. It was observed that the model showed a mean
accuracy of 85 percent. It is a known fact that it is impossible to predict happening of
a natural event by 100 percent through any human made system but an efficient
program with good approachability can be used to caution people well in advance
and to plan rescue operations. As 60 percent of total destructions and deaths caused
by natural disasters was due to lack of awareness and late action of authorities, this
algorithm could be efficiently used to defend the after effects of an infamous natural
disaster landslide.
